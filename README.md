# Launger web-app
Launger is a time management app based on the Pomodoro technique but designed specifically for true procrastinators by motivating and rewarding the user using social media and mini-games (YouTube, TikTok, Reddit, Slither.IO, etc.). The more they work, the more social media they can consume.
